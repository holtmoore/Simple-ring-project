## About the Project

In this project is a Boss Fight game for one player where you simulate random fights. The project was initially a knight vs boss sim fight but it was posing issues so I decided to just make it Boss vs Boss. Once you load it up press the start button Two random booses will pop up and then press finish battle to see the winner.

## Aprouch Taken

I first set my HTML then began with my classes. then set up my AJAX and to pull boss data from API. then set my functions for game, generateRandomboss, startBattle, finishBattle ECT(useing jQuery throughout). i was trying to pull health and level out of the API but one of the instuctors pointed out that i needed to use the runes ID instead. at first when i would hit start battle multiple time it would display multiple images so I added bossImagesContainer to remove them(im pretty sure. needed help on that part) then wrapped it up with the finish battle function to pull winner image and have "Winner above boss pic" when button is clicked.
